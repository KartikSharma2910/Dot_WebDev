React Js Notes

- Used for creating UI
- Learn JS refresher before beginning with react

Why should I use React JS

1.  Js is based on imperative approach (We need to define everything step by step)‚Ä®
    - First create
    - Then Define
    - Then execute
    - More effort and time is consumed‚Ä®
2.  React Js is based on declarative approach (We just need to tell what we want)‚Ä®
    - We don‚Äôt need to worry how everything is working
    - SPA (Single page application / Only 1 HTML page (changed dynamically))
    - React is like recursion 
    - We need to write less code
    - Component based architecture (Modular Code)
    - Function == Component (In react)

Benefits of Modular Code / React Js

- Reusable Code
- Less Duplication of data.
- Follows DRY concept (Do not repeat yourself)
- SOC (Separation of concern (Things are separated accordingly))
- Easily Readable  
- Easily Manageable

Moto of 1st Class

- React - Syntax - (JSX)
- React is all about components
- How to pass data in components ? 
- Component = Reusable piece of code / Reusable building blocks of UI


Components in React‚Ä®
- Piece of code which is used again and again (like we make functions in other language)

More from React

#1st Way to setup react

# Package Json File

- It is a file where all the dependency and script are defined with their version.
- All the 3rd party files and library are in node modules folder

# Index Js File

- Entry point of React (This is the first file which will be executed)
- We need to import files to use them.
- Create root element in HTML and then  make a element in index Js file
- Then root.render(<App/>)
- Everything will be rendered inside app component

# Src folder

- All the development will be done here
- Root element lies in index.html file in public folder

# npm I command is used to install all dependency.

 
JSX - Javascript XML (Special syntax to write HTML and javascript together).


Browser doesn‚Äôt understand React JS

- It is converted to normal browser understandable code
- Converted by Compiler
- Browser only understand (HTML , CSS, Javascript)

Do you know ?
- Why we use className instead of class in react?
    - Because class is a reserved keyword in javascript  (Interesting üòÅ)


# What is JSX ?

- npm start command convert JSX to browser readable format
